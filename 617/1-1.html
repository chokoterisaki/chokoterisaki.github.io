          Kiwi Office. That's the name of my recently founded office of fixers.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Everyone, we received a grade raise from the Hana Association!
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— Finally!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Thanks for the news, Marisco. We really placed all our efforts on
          those last jobs.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          As of now, our three-fixer office has a decent Grade 6 rank. <br />We
          mostly take dangerous requests, such as Backstreets patroling, Urban
          Myth busting, Outskirts logistic... yet this time there was a special
          type of work.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — I'll check if there's any welcome job for our new grade...
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">— Huh? R Corp?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— A REQUEST FROM R CORP? HOW?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— You mean that paramilitar Wing?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Yes, it seems they are seeking for corporate espionage.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— Now that's interesting.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Let's head out to District 22 so we can discuss the details with the
          agent.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          As we departed, I was reminiscent of why I wanted to create this
          office. <br />
          I always wanted to be a fixer. I wanted to do things for the City that
          no one else would dare to. Tea and Marisco joined my cause because we
          kind of were acquaintances, and they shared the feeling and the will
          of helping those in need. <br />
          We really aren't that much of a charity, it's more of a
          peacekeeping... or hero-like duty. We also thought of animal rescuing,
          wildlife conserving and the such services, but we had to settle a good
          reputation for Associations first.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">— Hmm... so you are the guys?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          That's the agent. She was indeed an R Corp. soldier, can't tell much
          more from my ignorance on Wings but she didn't bring the usual helmet,
          revealing a palid skin and long dark-purple hair.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— Yeah. Kiwi Office, that is.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — You seem more skilled than a 'Grade 6 Office' though.<br />
          — That'll be ideal for the job, since R Corp. would require you to
          have a look into another Wing's facility, not necessarily with their
          permission.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — What's the catch, though. This is an illegal operation, right?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — Not at all. If we were to stick to any laws, there's no problem in
          Wings having their own conflicts, or distrust to be exact.<br />
          — You see, there's this Wing of District 12 we have a business
          contract with, but we've happened to have some inquiries about their
          working conditions as we observed an understimation of fellow agents'
          succeed rate, which is rare. <br />
          — Your Office would be focusing on District 7's branch. You find a way
          to sneak inside, get through the different sections and make
          observations of the branch's functioning. <br />
          — The payment can be talked. If you don't dissapoint, it'll be worth
          the effort.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Seems good enough. we'll be in contact soon, then. <br />
