          Coffee Office. That's the name of our two-fixer office.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— Marisco, we were just ascended to Grade 6!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Finally... I hope the new jobs can pay this month's rent. Can you
          check, Tea?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— Sure!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          As of now, we have a decent Grade 5 rank. <br />We mostly take
          medium-level requests such as Backstreets patroling, wildlife
          conserving, Outskirts logistic... yet this time there was a special
          type of work.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — Let's see... Huh? There's just a request from a Wing, "L Corp."
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— Wait, only one? And from a Wing?<br /></p>

        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — Yes, it seems they are seeking for temporal employing.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Hmm... this may be our first time working for a Wing. It should pay
          whole months of rent, they say. — Speaking of, isn't L Corp. that
          energy Wing that everyone end up applying?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — You mean, like our colleagues back in school? Yeah! We could see how
          they are doing!
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Yeah... you know, from our friend group back then... Nia and Edd
          owed me a guitar. For themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — Oh, you still want to make the band? Probably Aze can even afford a
          battery now!
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Hah, sure. Though, I'd hope we also meet the others, like, the ones
          we used to hang up as well, with our group.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — We can find out what's up with those beautiful people if we get to
          work!
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Oh, fine, let me sign in and we're going.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          Then we departed to District 7, where our assigned L Corp. branch
          called us.<br />
          When we graduated, our college friends told us they'd start with the
          employee opportunity at this wing and then see how it goes. I don't
          recall how many of them actually did so, but since me and Tea decided
          to become fixers and help those in need, we've lost contact with them.
          I really looked forward to our old friendships, so having a new chance
          now may be a new arc in our lives.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">— Hmm... so you are the guys?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          That's the agent. She was indeed an R Corp. soldier, can't tell much
          more from my ignorance on Wings but she didn't bring the signature
          helmet, revealing a palid skin and long dark-purple hair.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— Yeah. Kiwi Office, that is.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — You seem more skilled than a 'Grade 6 Office' though.<br />
          — That'll be ideal for the job, since R Corp. would require you to
          have a look into another Wing's facility, not necessarily with their
          permission.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — What's the catch, though. This is an illegal operation, right?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — Not at all. If we were to stick to any laws, there's no problem in
          Wings having their own conflicts, or distrust to be exact.<br />
          — You see, there's this Wing of District 12 we have a business
          contract with, but we've happened to have some inquiries about their
          working conditions as we observed an understimation of fellow agents'
          succeed rate, which is rare. <br />
          — Your Office would be focusing on District 7's branch. You find a way
          to sneak inside, get through the different sections and make
          observations of the branch's functioning. <br />
          — The payment, as you may already know, is indeed worth the while.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Seems good enough. we'll be in contact soon, then. <br />
