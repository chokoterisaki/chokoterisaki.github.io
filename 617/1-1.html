          Coffee Office. That's the name of our two-fixer office.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— Marisco, we were just ascended to Grade 6!</p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — Finally! Can you check on the updated jobs?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">— Sure.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          As of now, we have a decent Grade 5 rank. <br />We mostly take
          medium-level requests such as Backstreets patroling, wildlife
          conserving, Outskirts logistic... yet this time there was a special
          type of work.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — Huh? There's a request from a Wing, "L Corp."
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — L Corp?<br />
          — You mean the energy Wing?
        </p>

        <p class="w3-text-blue">
          — Yes, it seems they are seeking for temporal employing.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">
          — We can give it a try. Wings can pay whole months of rent.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Let's head out to District 22 so we can discuss the details with the
          agent.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          As we departed, I was reminiscent of why I wanted to create this
          office. <br />
          I always wanted to be a fixer. I wanted to do things for the City that
          no one else would dare to. Tea and Marisco joined my cause because we
          kind of were acquaintances, and they shared the feeling and the will
          of helping those in need. <br />
          We really aren't that much of a charity, it's more of a
          peacekeeping... or hero-like duty. We also thought of animal rescuing,
          wildlife conserving and the such services, but we had to settle a good
          reputation for Associations first.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">— Hmm... so you are the guys?</p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          That's the agent. She was indeed an R Corp. soldier, can't tell much
          more from my ignorance on Wings but she didn't bring the signature
          helmet, revealing a palid skin and long dark-purple hair.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-purple">— Yeah. Kiwi Office, that is.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — You seem more skilled than a 'Grade 6 Office' though.<br />
          — That'll be ideal for the job, since R Corp. would require you to
          have a look into another Wing's facility, not necessarily with their
          permission.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — What's the catch, though. This is an illegal operation, right?
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-pink">
          — Not at all. If we were to stick to any laws, there's no problem in
          Wings having their own conflicts, or distrust to be exact.<br />
          — You see, there's this Wing of District 12 we have a business
          contract with, but we've happened to have some inquiries about their
          working conditions as we observed an understimation of fellow agents'
          succeed rate, which is rare. <br />
          — Your Office would be focusing on District 7's branch. You find a way
          to sneak inside, get through the different sections and make
          observations of the branch's functioning. <br />
          — The payment, as you may already know, is indeed worth the while.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-lime">
          — Seems good enough. we'll be in contact soon, then. <br />
